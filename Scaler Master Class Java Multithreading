What is thread 
It is a task, light weight process 

Process doesnt run on the CPU but thread

Creating threads 1. Thread 2. Runnable 

class MyClass : extends Threads
{
  public void run(){
  }
}

class Main
{
public static void main(){

MyClass myThread = new MyClass()
myThread.start();
}
}

2. Runnable 

class MyClass : implement Runnable 
{
  public void run(){
  }
}

class Main
{
public static void main(){
  
  Runnable run = new MyClass();
  Thread thread = new Thread (run);
  thread.start();
  
  
}

}
Why runnables ?
In java doesent support multiple inheritance, so we can use runnable here
